# GetInData ML Framework

GetInData Machine Learning Framework is a set of complete blueprints for solving typical machine learning problems. It leverages best-in-class open source technologies and materializes best practices for structuring and developing machine learning solutions.

## Overview <a name="overview"></a>

A brief summary of why GID ML Framework was brought to life:
- to decrease time-to-market by enabling faster PoCs
- to share best practices for developing ML products
- to organize and standardize Way-of-Work for data scientists

To achieve the above goals, we do not aim to create any ML platform or any specific code package. On the other hand, we also do not want to only share theoretical insights about way-of-work or describe our project experience. Instead, we are creating a **library of solved machine learning use cases that implement ML code development best practices using modern open-source technology stack.** Some of the most important features tha our GID ML Framework provides are:
- Transferable environments (local/cloud)
- Production quality code from the start
- Well-organized configuration
- Careful dependency management
- Experiment tracking and model versioning
- Node/pipeline-based modular workflow that is fully reproducible and reusable
- Comprehensive documentation and test coverage
- Predefined, standard use cases (blueprints)

### Creating a new project <a name="howtostart-new"></a>

The best way to create a new project is to use GID ML Framework starter. The repository and instructions can be found [here - TO BE UPDATED](https://gitlab.com/getindata/aa-labs/coe/gid-ml-framework-starter/-/tree/main). After creating a new project, follow the guidelines for existing projects.
