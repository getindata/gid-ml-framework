# GetInData ML Framework - Graph Neural Networks For Sequential Recommendations

## Overview

`recommender_gnn` is one of use cases implemented within GetInData ML Framework. The purpose of this use case is to
demonstrate the utilization of an example graph network that achieves state-of-the-art results for a recommendation task
on sequential data.

## Data



## Models

For now examples are implemented with use of Dynamic Graph Neural Networks for Sequential 
Recommendation (Zhang et al., [2022](https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2022.3151618))
